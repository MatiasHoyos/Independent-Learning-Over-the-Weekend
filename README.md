This exploration focuses in the S&P 500 stock index. The data set contains information regarding: Dividend Yield, Price, Sector, Price/Earnings, and  other important financial information. 
In my program i analyse the columns of Price/Earnings, Price/Book, EBITDA and sort the stocks from the index from greatest to smallest.
Another part of the program looks at the Dividend Yield and Sector per company. It get the overall mean Dividend Yield per sector and the median value. Finally a bar chart displaying this data is shown.

From the results that the program display we can tell the following:
  .The best Price/Earnings companies are: Salesforce.com, Baker Hughes, and Amazon.com Inc .
  .The worst companies: Apache Corporation, Incyte , National Oilwell Varco Inc.
  
  .The best Price/Book companies are:  Brighthouse Financial Inc , Range Resources Corp., Envision Healthcare 
  .The worst companies: Union Pacific, TransDigm Group, Occidental Petroleum 
  
  .The best EBITA companies are: FirstEnergy Corp, Allergan, Hess Corporation
  .The best are: Apple Inc, AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications 
  
  .The sector with the best mean dividend yield is Telecomunications Services and the worst one is Health Care.
  
  From working independently I have learned how to employ new tools which have allowed me to learn new programs and code. I have also learned and improved my computational thinking since I faced many challenges but still found ways to solve them by breaking the proem down into smaller bits.
